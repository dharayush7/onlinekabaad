            Until now, the waste economy mainly operated on a 'take, make and
            dispose'​ model popularly known to be a linear model which led to
            the growing pressure of manufacturing and consumption on our scarce
            natural resources and environment. To counter that problem, the rise
            of the circular economy concept came about to help in the
            sustainable growth of businesses.

            principles of circular economy, the products in its end of life
            stage are pushed back into the economy by practising the phenomenon
            of reusing, repairing, remanufacturing, and recycling existing
            materials and products.
